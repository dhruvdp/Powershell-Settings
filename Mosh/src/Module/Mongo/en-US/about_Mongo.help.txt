SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Exposes Mongo databases and collections as PowerShell drives.

LONG DESCRIPTION

	MongoDB is an open-source doucment database.  The Mongo module allows PowerShell
	to interact with Mongo databases as if the database were a drive on your 
	system.
	
	To use the module, you must import the Mongo module into your session:
	
		import-module mongo
		
	Once imported, you can create new PowerShell drives representing a Mongo 
	database using the new-psdrive cmdlet:
	
		new-psdrive -name db -psp mongo -root '' -connectionstring 'mongodb://server'

	Once the drive is defined, you can interact with the Mongo server using the
	standard item PowerShell cmdlets.  The provider currently supports these item
	cmdlets:
	
		* new-item 
		* get-item 
		* set-item
		* remove-item 
		* get-childitems
