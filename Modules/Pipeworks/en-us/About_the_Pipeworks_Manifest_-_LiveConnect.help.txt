The LiveConnect section of the Pipeworks manifest describes Live Connect application data.  


It contains the ClientID of the app, as well as a secure setting pointing to the Client Secret Key.


Here is an example:


    @{
        LiveConnect = @{        
            ClientId = '00000000440DBD88'
            ClientSecretSetting = 'StartLearningPowerShellLiveSecret'
        }
    }
