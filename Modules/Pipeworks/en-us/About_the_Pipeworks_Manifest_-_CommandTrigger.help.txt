The CommandTrigger section of the PipeworksManifest describes when commands will be triggered on a device.  At current, only one setting is supported: Shake. 


Here is an example of a Pipeworks manifest with a CommandTrigger section:

    @{
        CommandTrigger = @{
            "Shake" = "Get-RandomPowerShellTip"
        }
    }
