The CSS section of the pipeworks manifest describes CSS style pages to use with each page.  


It is a hashtable, with the key describing the style page and the value containing the path to the page.


Here's a quick example of the CSS section:

    @{    
        Css = @{
            "PowerShellStyleSheet" = "/CSS/Gangamstyle.css"
        }
    }
