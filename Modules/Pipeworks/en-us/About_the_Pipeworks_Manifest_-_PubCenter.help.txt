The PubCenter section of the Pipeworks manifest describes how PubCenter ads will be placed in a Win8 application.


Like the AdSense section, it requires an ID, and a BottomAdSlot or TopAdSlot are supported:


Here's an example:

    @{
        PubCenter = @{
            ApplicationId = "1b9271e7-0be4-4ef1-84c3-9e8f921c1b4a"
            BottomAdUnit = "10048228"
        }
    }
